# Specification Quality Checklist: Server-Authoritative Timer and Frozen-Tile Tiebreaker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.
- Edge cases call out "both" frozen tiles and concurrent clock expiry; these can be resolved in clarify or plan (e.g. "both" counts for neither for tiebreaker; both clocks zero → end match, winner by score then frozen tiles).
- Assumptions document that round timestamps and frozen tile storage exist or are derivable; no NEEDS CLARIFICATION used so planning can choose concrete fields.
